# Event Handling and Async

## Click Events

1. Add an `onclick` listener to the `window` that logs the `event.target` property
2. Add an `onclick` listener to the `Logo` that `bolds` the logo text by applying a style
3. Do you expect the message to be logged when you click the logo?
    - try hovering over the logged elements to see where they are in the page


## Keypress Events

1. Add an `onkeyup` listener to the `search` that changes the `innerHTML` of the `lastPressed` element to the value of the key that was pressed
2. Add an `onkeyup` listener to the `search` that changes `Content` element content to the value of the input element
