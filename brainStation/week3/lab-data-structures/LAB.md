# Data Structures Lab

In this lab you will be writing code in `script.js` and running it by opening `index.html` in the browser or refreshing the page. Check your results (or errors) in the chrome inspector.

## Arrays
1. Create an array containing three strings in a single line
    - use web development terms that you have learned so far
    - use the **literal** syntax
2. `console.log` the array
3. `console.log` the first item in the array
4. `console.log` the last item in the array
    - what happens when you try to access an index that does not have an item? 
5. create the same array as you did in step 1, but this time start with an empty array and then `push` your strings
6. `console.log` this array to confirm it is same as your **literal** array
7. `pop` and then `console.log` each of the items in this array
    - how many items are in the array now?


## Objects
1. create an object that contains three properties using the **literal** syntax
    - firstName
      - your first name as a `string`
    - lastName
      - your last name as a `string`
    - likesCoffee
      - a `boolean` indicating whether or not you like coffee
2. create the same object but start with an empty object and then add the properties
    - have at least one example of **dot-notation** assigning and one example of **square brackets** assigning
3. `console.log` the `firstName` property of your object using **dot-notation** access
4. `console.log` the `lastName` property of your object using **square brackets** access
3. add the `console.log` function to your object as a new property called `speak`
4. use the `speak` property of your object to print the object's `likesCoffee` value to console
