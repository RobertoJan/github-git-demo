// --- Part 1: Logging information to the browser ---
/*
  The log() function writes a message.
  Use this while you debug code. Do not use it in your final code!
*/
console.log("Hello world!");
// you can also print many messages at a time
console.log("Hello", "world!");
/*
  The info() function is used to write an informational message.
  On chrome it might not look different from the log() above, but on Firefox
  it shows up with a little 'i' icon next to it!
*/
console.info("This is an informational bulletin.");
/*
  The error() function, writes an error.
  Use this when your code has taken a bad turn somewhere!
*/
console.error("This is an error! Ahh!");
/*
  The warn() function writes a warning to the console.
  Use this for things not as serious as an error but more important than a simple log message.
*/
console.warn("This is a warning.");
